While intended to inform the user that there is a task they need to complete, it can also be used to send receipt of a submission, a summary reply, or any other email. For example, a manager might receive an email notifying them of a ticket that has been raised, while the customer might receive a notification that their issue has been assigned to a manager to look into.</p><p>You have the option to set <code>Retry on Failure</code> to either <code>Yes</code> or <code>No</code>. If the email fails to send for whatever reason and this value is set to <code>Yes</code> then the request will be sent again a number of times before eventually setting the event status to <code>Failed</code>. We would recommend setting this to <code>Yes</code>, because SMTP servers can reject messages unpredictably during busy periods.</p>',3),n=[i];function r(c,d,l,m,h,_){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const f=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
