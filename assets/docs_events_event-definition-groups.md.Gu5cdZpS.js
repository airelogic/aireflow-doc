The ability to nest the event keys in groups allows for a simplified workflow design allowing you to assign group triggers to tasks instead of requiring a trigger for each event key, thus reducing clutter.</p><h2 id="how-do-event-definition-groups-work-within-workflows" tabindex="-1">How do Event Definition Groups work within workflows? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-event-definition-groups-work-within-workflows" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do Event Definition Groups work within workflows?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For example, lets say you have an event definition group with the group key <code>event-group-1</code> with 3 event keys (<code>event-key-1</code>, <code>event-key-2</code>, and <code>event-key-3</code>) assigned to the group. You can then add a trigger for this group to a workflow task definition by selecting the <code>group</code> event type and then the group event <code>event-group-1</code>. This would then mean that any of the event keys assigned to this event definition group (<code>event-key-1</code>, <code>event-key-2</code>, and <code>event-key-3</code>) would trigger this task or mutation.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-create-an-event-definition-group" tabindex="-1">How do you create an Event Definition Group? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-you-create-an-event-definition-group" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do you create an Event Definition Group?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To create an event definition group, click the Event Definition Groups tab in the side bar menu and then click the plus (+) icon in the top right of the page. Here you must enter a unique name for the event definition group as well as a unique group key. Please note it is not possible to edit the group key after creation, however you will be able to edit the name. Once you are happy you can click the check button. Your created event definition group will now appear in the list and you will have a few actions available to you to manage this group.</p><h3 id="group-key-formatting-rules" tabindex="-1">Group Key Formatting Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#group-key-formatting-rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Group Key Formatting Rules&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are a number of formatting rules which are set out which you must follow. They are as follows:</p><ul><li>Only contains lowercase letters, numbers and dashes, e.g. <code>key-123</code>.</li><li>Starts with a letter e.g. <code>123-key</code> will not be valid but <code>key-123</code> will be.</li></ul><h2 id="event-definition-group-actions" tabindex="-1">Event Definition Group Actions <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-definition-group-actions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Definition Group Actions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="editing-group-name" tabindex="-1">Editing Group Name <a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-group-name" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Editing Group Name&quot;">​</a></h3><p>By clicking on the event definition group name you will be able to edit the name value.

Please note that deleting an event definition group won’t remove it from any task triggers within workflow definitions, however any events in the group will no longer trigger those tasks or mutations. For example, before deleting the group, if you had an event definition group with the group key <code>event-group-1</code> with 3 event keys (<code>event-key-1</code>, <code>event-key-2</code>, and <code>event-key-3</code>) assigned and then you had a workflow definition with a task which is triggered by <code>event-group-1</code> then any of the event keys (<code>event-key-1</code>, <code>event-key-2</code>, and <code>event-key-3</code>) would trigger this task. However, after deleting the event definition group <code>event-group-1</code> the event keys (<code>event-key-1</code>, <code>event-key-2</code>, and <code>event-key-3</code>) would no longer trigger the task, however the event definition group key <code>event-group-1</code> would still remain in the workflows task definition. It should also be noted that because <code>event-group-1</code> still remains in the workflow task definition that if you were to create a new event definition group with the key <code>event-group-1</code> then the triggers would become active again and any event keys defined in the new <code>event-group-1</code> would now trigger the task/mutation.</p><h3 id="exporting-and-importing-groups" tabindex="-1">Exporting and Importing Groups <a class="header-anchor" href="#exporting-and-importing-groups" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exporting and Importing Groups&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There is an option to export event definition groups. Clicking the export button will open a json formatted text area where you can copy this value and then import using the import option next to the plus (+) button in the top right of the page. You will need to ensure that when you import the group that the name and groupKey values are both unique.</p><h3 id="editing-group-s-event-keys" tabindex="-1">Editing Group&#39;s Event Keys <a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-group-s-event-keys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Editing Group&#39;s Event Keys&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Here you will be able to select event definitions which you have already defined in the event definitions page using the dropdown, as well as being able to type an event key which you do not have a definition for and then hit enter to add it to the group. Once you have selected/added your event keys to the group you can then click the <code>save</code> button. You also have the option of removing the event keys from the event definition group by clicking the <code>X</code> button on the event key you would like to remove and then clicking <code>save</code>.</p><h3 id="assigning-a-group-as-a-task-trigger" tabindex="-1">Assigning a Group as a Task Trigger <a class="header-anchor" href="#assigning-a-group-as-a-task-trigger" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Assigning a Group as a Task Trigger&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You can then add a trigger against a workflow task definition by selecting the <code>group</code> event type and then the group event e.g. <code>event-group-1</code>.
