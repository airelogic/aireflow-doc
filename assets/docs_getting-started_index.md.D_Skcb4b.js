There are three main concepts that define how AireFlow works: tasks, events &amp; workflow definitions. Workflow definitions define templates for tasks to be created when certain events happen.</p><p>Some examples of tasks could be:</p><ul><li>Reviewing a form submission</li><li>Sending an email to a clinician</li><li>Waiting for a patient to respond to a form</li></ul><p>Some examples of events could be:</p><ul><li>A form being submitted</li><li>A button being clicked in a third party system</li><li>A task being created</li><li>A task being completed</li></ul><p>AireFlow is intended for integration with other systems rather than being a standalone service. The preferred approach is to use our multi-tenanted <a href="https://flow.aireinnovate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">production instance</a>. However, in certain situations where it is required, we are able to create on-prem installations.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-create-real-tasks" tabindex="-1">How do I create real tasks? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-create-real-tasks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I create real tasks?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Before you can create task instances for a real world use case, you must start with a <a href="./../workflows/">workflow definition</a> to describe the type of tasks you want to create.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve defined your task, you need to specify which type of event will cause a task instance to be created by adding <a href="./../events/">a trigger</a>.</p><p>Now that you have a task definition with a trigger, whenever the relevant event happens a new task instance will be created. Most workflows will need to start with a Custom Event, which is fired by calling the events API. Alternatively, to test your workflow from the management screens, go to the Event Definitions page and click the send icon on the right hand side of an event. Enter the relevant values and click Fire Event to simulate a call to the events API.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-see-what-aireflow-is-doing" tabindex="-1">How can I see what AireFlow is doing? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-see-what-aireflow-is-doing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How can I see what AireFlow is doing?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The easiest way to see what AireFlow is doing is to visit the Event Log, where you can see a list of every event that has been processed. This screen will show you both custom events and task events, so you can see which events have been sent from external systems (such as AireForms) via the api, as well as events that have been emitted by tasks being created and updated.</p><p>You can also search by any field to narrow the Event Log down to some more specific events, for example you could enter a subject ID in the search bar to see all events for a particular patient, or you could enter a workflow name to see any events from a specific workflow.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-create-a-tenant" tabindex="-1">How do I create a tenant? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-create-a-tenant" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I create a tenant?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Currently we do not have the ability to add a tenant through the AireFlow interface. This is a technical task and requires a member of the AireFlow development team to create a new tenant.</p>',17),r=[n];function s(l,h,d,c,w,f){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const m=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
