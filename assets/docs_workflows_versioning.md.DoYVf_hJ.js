This means that you can create new versions of an entire workflow definition, but not individual tasks within a workflow.</p><h2 id="creating-a-new-version" tabindex="-1">Creating A New Version <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-new-version" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating A New Version&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To create a new version of a workflow, open the version manager by clicking the version in the workflow definitions list, then click &quot;New Version&quot;. This will create a new version by duplicating the previous highest version. All triggers based on task events inside the workflow will be updated, but any tasks from separate workflow definitions that rely on task events from this workflow will need a new trigger adding to point to the new version of your tasks.</p><p>New versions are disabled by default, so nothing in your existing process will change until the new version is enabled.</p><h2 id="enabling-or-disabling-a-version" tabindex="-1">Enabling or Disabling A Version <a class="header-anchor" href="#enabling-or-disabling-a-version" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Enabling or Disabling A Version&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Using the version manager, a workflow version can be enabled or disabled. When a version is disabled, no tasks within it will be triggered. That includes both tasks triggered by custom events, and tasks triggered by events from other tasks.</p><p>Multiple versions of a workflow can be enabled simultaneously, however this can result in duplicate tasks being created if more than one version has tasks with similar triggers.</p><h2 id="editing-a-version" tabindex="-1">Editing A Version <a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-a-version" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Editing A Version&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To edit a specific version of a workflow, select that version using the version manager popup, then open the workflow editor panel like usual.</p><h2 id="upgrading-in-flight-workflows" tabindex="-1">Upgrading In-Flight Workflows <a class="header-anchor" href="#upgrading-in-flight-workflows" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Upgrading In-Flight Workflows&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you have a long running workflow that someone is part-way through, disabling that version will prevent any further tasks in that workflow version from being created. If you only want to prevent new instances of that workflow being started, but allow existing ones to continue, then you should remove any custom event triggers from tasks at the start of the workflow, but leave the version enabled.</p><p>By removing only the triggers at the start of a workflow, any already running instances can be completed, but new custom events won&#39;t start the workflow for anybody else because there will be no relevant triggers. If there are any other workflow definitions that are triggered by the same custom events, they won&#39;t be affected by changes to triggers elsewhere.</p><h2 id="recomended-version-upgrade-strategy" tabindex="-1">Recomended Version Upgrade Strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="#recomended-version-upgrade-strategy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recomended Version Upgrade Strategy&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Only use a new version when something substantial needs to change, or you need to keep currently running workflows separate from instances of the new version</li><li>Try to make changes compatible with already running workflows where possible</li><li>Consider any clinical safety risks when disabling or enabling versions, and contact <a href="mailto:support@airelogic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">support@airelogic.com</a> and <a href="mailto:clinical.safety@airelogic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">clinical.safety@airelogic.com</a> if any support is needed</li></ul>',16),t=[r];function s(l,d,h,g,w,c){return o(),n("div",null,t)}const p=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,p as default};
